Good afternoon, everyone. As Janet said, we are speaking with you tonight from a remote location. I'd like to welcome you all to our call.I'm happy to be here and excited for you to hear from some of our new leadership team as Janet described. Our presentation agenda for today includes an update on the strategic focus of the business, including our near-term actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our approach to store reopenings. Next, Gustavo will review our first-quarter financial results. Then John will give us an update on the strategic focus of our operations, and Joe will do the same from a commercial perspective.We will then take questions. The first half of 2020 has been extraordinary by any measure. No one could have anticipated the scale of the impact from this pandemic on this global economy and our own North American business, let alone the massive amount of decisions we would have to make to keep our people, customers, and communities safe. I'm very proud of how our teams came together to assess the risks, understand the consequences, and take decisive action.These decisions have not been easy, and we are aware of their consequences, especially for those of our associates impacted by the furlough, but I believe our response was the right one for the short, medium, and long-term health of our people and our business. Throughout the quarter, we remained hyper-focused on ensuring liquidity and optimizing costs, including actions to improve cash flow generation. We swiftly implemented various actions to maintain our financial flexibility including a tight control on operating expenses, managing our inventory, postponing some capital investments, and suspending our capital allocation plans for share repurchase, debt reduction, and quarterly dividends. We succeeded in controlling our monthly cash burn and ended the quarter in a strong cash investment position of $1.2 billion.Last month, after the quarter close, we further strengthened our liquidity with a new three-year $850 million asset-based revolving credit facility. We are confident about our financial position and their ability to manage through these uncertain times. While we have been managing through this difficult environment, we have not lost focus on our strategic imperative to rebuild our authority in the home space. We continue to make strong progress and even accelerated several elements of our transformation assets.Importantly, we onboarded five new senior leaders during the quarter, which was no small feat: Gustavo Arnal, chief financial officer and treasurer; John Hartmann, chief operating officer and president of Buy Buy Baby; Rafeh Masood, chief digital officer; Arlene Hong, chief legal officer, and corporate sectary; and Cindy Davis, our new chief brand officer and president of Decorist. These five joined Joe Hartsig, our chief merchandising officer and president of Harmon Stores, who joined in March; and Gregg Melnick, chief stores officer, who was appointed to his new role in May and previously served as our interim chief digital officer. I spent many months, supported by the board, meeting candidates who have the right skills, experience, and character to take our business to the next level. Our diverse team of highly experienced retail experts is complete.I'm delighted to finally have them all on board to accelerate the pace of transformation. Now from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, we've prioritized the health and safety of our team, customers, and communities. We closed the vast majority of our retail banner stores on March 23rd across the U.S. and Canada, excluding most Buy Buy Baby and Harmon Face Values stores.As a result, nearly 90% of our locations remain closed during the majority of the quarter, leading to a 49% decline in net sales. This was a critical moment, and we needed to act quickly. It was an important opportunity for us to pivot to a new model and support changing customer preferences and our omni-always approach. Now with the vast majority of our stores closed, we realigned our network and converted 25% of our total store fleet into regional fulfillment centers, nearly doubling our fulfillment capacity to handle the dramatic shift in demand to our own digital channels and unlock store inventory.Building on our fulfillment capabilities, we accelerated the pre-planned rollout of our Buy Online Pick up In Store or BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services offered in April, which is one of the key highlights of the quarter, especially for our Buy Buy Baby banner. As John will discuss in a few minutes, this was a game-changer for us as it allowed us to restart operations and serve customers at locations that were still closed to the public. By the time we ended the quarter in late May, we were offering BOPIS and Curbside Pickup at nearly 60% of our store locations. These new capabilities powered digital sales growth of more than 100% during the month of April and May.Net sales from our digital channels grew 82% in the first quarter and therefore, represented nearly two-thirds of total net sales. Digital growth was also favorably impacted by the way we pivoted our merchandising and marketing plans and how we engage with our customers, including more frequent updates through our website to stay current and relevant. Joe will talk more about this in a few minutes, but a key highlight for us was the strong growth we saw in new customer acquisition through our digital channels. Nearly 40% of our online orders were placed by customers who are new to ordering online with us, and over 10% of them were also completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond.In late May, we began taking measured steps to reopen stores to the public, including the launch of our store safety plan to help ensure customers can shop in our stores confidently. During the past month, the pace of store reopenings has accelerated in line with changing local and state regulations, market data, and the wider retail landscape. Our strong financial flexibility allowed us to implement a market-by-market approach, while we invest in rebuilding our business and introducing new services for our customers. I want to thank our dedicated teams for helping us resume operations safely and welcoming back our loyal customers.We are proud of our teams and how quickly they adapted and took decisive actions to keep our people safe and deliver for our customers. As of today, nearly all our stores have reopened to the public, and we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and customers. We're seeing good results across our reopened stores, and it's clear from the feedback we're hearing, the customers are delighted to be able to again shop in our stores and are taking advantage of the new BOPIS and curbside services. At the same time, we continue to see gradual recovery with the sales trends across our digital channels and growth, consistently more than 80% during the month of June.It is still early in the reopening process and the virus and its impact are still unpredictable, but we're encouraged by our customer support and response so far. This COVID moment has provided many learnings that we are capitalizing on as we continue to track against our strategic objectives. As previously stated, we have grounded our strategic framework in five key pillars: product, price, place, promise, and people. You'll hear more about the product, price, and place pillars today from John and Joe.With these five pillars as our guide, we've embraced a commitment to reconstruct and modernize our operating model to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness, charting a new course for our company. To start, we redefined our purpose to make it easy to feel at home. This is a defining role of our business place for our customers, the North Star that guides all our actions. To achieve this purpose, our mission is to reestablish our authority and be the preferred home destination driven by teams consistently delivering balanced, durable growth.We believe this mission is more relevant today than ever when home is everything and being safe at home with family is essential. Bed Bath & Beyond takes on an even more important role, supporting customers and their families by making it easy to feel at home. In addition to the pillar strategies, we're also focused on investing and improving core proficiencies, the plumbing of a house that is essential to rebuilding the foundations of our business. This COVID moment also represents an opportunity for us to drive strong actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program.We have accelerated the further alignment of our cost structure with our near-term performance related to the pandemic. These include, among other things, our efforts to reduce the cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation to address current gross margin pressures related to the substantial shift of sales from stores to digital channels. Furthermore, we plan to close approximately 200 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores over the next two years under our store network optimization project and focus on other SG&A expense reductions. We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluding related onetime costs.We're also making additional investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth. As we previously outlined, we are committed to an ongoing review of our non-core business concepts. As of now, we have not factored any future proceeds from potential asset sales, including the sale of personalizationmall.com into our internal financial model. We plan to share the details around these actions and other short-term and longer-term goals and objectives during an Investor Day event expected to be held mid- to late October of this year.Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we don't know if we will host the meeting in person or virtually, but our Investor Relations team will share more detailed information later this summer. I will now turn the call over to Gustavo to review our first-quarter results in detail. Gustavo?Gustavo Arnal -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer"}, {"statement_num": 4, "section": "pres", "statement_type": "P", "speaker": "Gustavo Arnal", "role": "Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "affiliation": "", "text": "Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I look forward to continue interactions with our analysts and investor community over the weeks and months to come. I've been on the job around two months now, which in pandemic time feels more like two years. I have been delighted to join Bed Bath & Beyond's team and look forward to help strengthen a sustainable business model for our company.We have an iconic brand, so I was attracted by the challenge and the opportunity of transforming the company to restore relevance in the minds and homes of customers. Since I joined in May, our team has been intensively focused on ensuring liquidity and driving cost interventions as we manage our operations during the COVID crisis. This was achieved as we pivoted the company to a predominantly digital business while the majority of our stores were temporarily closed. Let me provide some highlights on our fiscal first quarter.First, it's important to note that our quarter spanned the three most critical months to date of the COVID-19 pandemic: March, April, and May. In response to this situation, our company acted quickly, prioritized interventions to maintain liquidity, and took actions to control cash burn. Keep in mind that by the time we announced the temporary closure of stores on March 23rd, we had already paid some monthly expenses such as payroll, rent, and other operational costs. So cash management strategies were into effect in conjunction with the store closure announcement in late March.Specifically, we furloughed the majority of our store associates and a portion of corporate associates. We started renegotiating with our vendors for extended payment terms and savings related to goods, services, and rent. We proactively managed inventory and canceled purchase orders. And we immediately reduced discretionary spending in areas, such as business travel, advertising, and expenses associated with the maintenance of stores, as well as deferred approximately $150 million in planned capital expenditures.As a result, we successfully lower our monthly cash burn and recorded a strong cash and investment balance of $1.2 billion by end May. And in June, we'll bolster our liquidity with a new $850 million asset-based lending facility, which provides substantial additional liquidity if needed. Our net sales were impacted by having the vast majorities of our stores closed during most of the quarter. We operated mainly as a digital business during these months.With this, our gross margin was impacted by channel and product mix resulting from the substantial shift of sales to our digital channels. Let's now look at our monthly cash burn. We entered the quarter in a very strong cash position coming off a year-end balance of $1.4 billion in cash and investments. In March, we elected to draw down the available $236 million from our unsecured revolving credit facility, which enhanced our cash position.As I said earlier, we have significant cash outflow during the first month. As we move into April, we implemented cash management strategies and carefully managed our inflows and outflows to reduce our cash burn. As we move into May, we were cash neutral, leaving us with a quarter-end balance of $1.2 billion in cash and investments. If we consider the available liquidity under the new ABL facility that we entered into after the quarter closed, we have a total liquidity of more than $1.8 billion in available funds.This is great insurance and provides further financial flexibility as we implement our store reopening plans and focus on driving important actions under the company's strategic transformation plan. Now I'll turn to the operational results of the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $2.44 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $2.91 in the prior-year period. Our reported net loss includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.48 per diluted share for special items mostly related to non-cash impairments of certain store-level assets and trade names.On a non-GAAP basis, our first-quarter net loss per diluted share was $1.96. Consistent with our prior disclosures, the remainder of our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis to better represent year-on-year performance of the business. Net sales in the quarter were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 49% from the first quarter of last year primarily due to the temporary store closures. On a directional basis, net sales from our digital channels increased by approximately 82%, while net sales from our stores declined about 77%.We experienced a strong digital growth each month of the quarter starting in March with net sales from our digital channels up 17% as compared to March 2019. Then during April and May, we experienced explosive growth across our digital channels with net sales up more than 100% each month compared to these same two months in 2019. These strong results were supported by rollout and subsequent expansion of our BOPIS and Curbside Pickup service offerings not only for Bed Bath & Beyond but also across our Buy Buy Baby, Harmon, and Cost Plus World Market stores. In June, after quarter end, we initiated our phased approach to store reopening as Mark discussed earlier.As of today, nearly all of our stores are open, and while it is still early days, we're pleased with the customer response. For the month of June, overall net sales decreased only 7%. During this same period, net sales from our digital channels remained strong with year-over-year growth in excess of 80%, while net sales from store declined approximately 25%, reflecting the gradual reopening during the course of the month. Moving to gross margin.Our gross margin was 26.7% of net sales, as compared to 34.5% last year. This 780 basis point decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact on channel and product mix in connection with the substantial shift in sales to digital channels. For some context, net sales from our digital channels represented nearly two-thirds of our total quarterly sales compared to penetration of nearly one-fifth in the prior-year period. The incremental direct-to-customer shipping expense represented the bulk of the channel mix impact.In addition, higher sales of lower-margin COVID-essential items contributed to pressure in product mix. Moving to SG&A. Adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter declined 15% or $123 million compared to the prior year. This decline reflects the impact from actions taken in response to COVID-19, including the associated furlough, lower discretionary spending, and benefits from the CARES Act credits and cost reduction interventions that were initiated at the end of fiscal 2019, such as the corporate restructuring program.As a percentage of net sales, first-quarter SG&A significantly increased to 55.3% from 32.9% of net sales in the prior-year period due to the impact of fixed costs on a net sales base that was about half of the prior year. A few additional balance sheet items. Retail inventories were $2.2 billion at cost, a modest increase versus year end as we took actions early in the quarter to cancel or reduce product purchase orders. Moving to CAPEX.Our capital expenditures were $42 million with approximately 55% of the expense related to technology projects, including inventory and warehouse management capabilities such as advanced allocation logic and replenishment strategies to meet the changing customer needs during this period. In regard to our capital allocation strategies, as a reminder, we have suspended our share repurchase and our quarterly dividend programs as part of our COVID response. The company remains committed to a capital return program over the mid to long term, and we'll reevaluate when appropriate. Due to the continued uncertainty related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we're not providing financial guidance for 2020.The situation is still evolving and remains volatile. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely in relation to our associates, customers, business partners and supply chain. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we're well-positioned to manage through these uncertain times. Before closing, I want to reiterate some of what Mark stated earlier.First, we continue to have a strong focus on liquidity management, and we'll continue to drive actions to improve cash flow generation. Second, we're pursuing deliberate actions as part of our ongoing restructuring program to reduce cost of goods and drive supply chain transformation. This will help address gross margin pressures related to the substantial shift of sales to digital channels. And as part of our store network optimization project, we plan to close approximately 200 stores over the next two years, representing about 21% of our total Bed Bath & Beyond stores, and we'll continue to focus on other SG&A expense reductions.We believe the aggregate benefit from these actions will generate future annualized savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluded related onetime costs. Third is that we're making further investments in our digital transformation to accelerate and drive growth. I will now turn the call over to John for an update on our transformation progress within our operations.John Hartmann -- Chief Operating Officer and President of Buy Buy BABY"}, {"statement_num": 5, "section": "pres", "statement_type": "P", "speaker": "John Hartmann", "role": "Chief Operating Officer and President of Buy Buy BABY", "affiliation": "", "text": "Thank you, Gustavo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to participate in my first earnings call with Bed Bath & Beyond. I joined the company a little less than two months ago, and like my colleagues, I have come up to speed rather quickly under these most unusual of circumstances. Mark's vision for the future was the major attraction for me to join Bed Bath & Beyond, and I'm excited to be part of the broader team that will together transform this great brand.Today, I'll be speaking about three topics: first, a few comments about how our operations pivoted in the face of the COVID pandemic and store closures and powered the growth of our digital channels; second, I will provide a few more details about our store network optimization project that was mentioned earlier; and third, an update on the end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain. As the COVID pandemic took hold in late March and forced the temporary closure of the majority of our stores, we rapidly evolved our operations to meet the changing needs of customers. As our stores closed, people across the country and beyond needed us more than ever to deliver essential products to their homes. To support the increased demand across our digital channels, we rapidly converted about 25% of our stores across the U.S.and Canada into regional fulfillment centers, which almost doubled our digital fulfillment capacity during the quarter. This allowed us to leverage the vast inventory resources within our stores with assigned web orders locally and deliver quickly and enabled us to ship online orders in two days or less on average or make orders available for pickup in less than two hours. Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our teams, we accelerated the launch of BOPIS and contactless curbside pickup services in mid-April starting with Buy Buy Baby and Harmon Stores that remained open and expanding to Bed Bath & Beyond and Cost Plus World Market stores that remain closed to the public. By the end of the quarter, these offerings had expanded to nearly 60% of our total stores.Customer response has increasingly been favorable, which shows how important the strategic investment in BOPIS and Curbside Pickup is to our business and to our customers. As our stores reopen, we are expanding the services to these locations, and we'll continue to optimize our omni fulfillment capabilities. In this COVID moment, we believe we can take this opportunity to not just simply close stores but to pivot and reshape and truly optimize our store footprint. We continue to believe that our physical store channel is an asset for us as we transform into a digital-first company, especially with our new omni fulfillment capabilities in BOPIS and curbside.As our initial work gets under way, we are building off the network optimization project that was completed by the company last year. Our approach includes a much deeper analysis of both individual store and market data. Recent geo analytical modeling shows that our Bed Bath & Beyond banner has lagged the market in store and digital sales growth. More specifically, we believe that the current physical footprint of our stores only addresses about 80% to 85% of the market opportunity and does not fully align to the local market sales demand.Our immediate goal is to rightsize our store network in such a way that reduces redundant stores and supports a digital-first platform with the appropriate number of stores in the right locations to serve customer demand and accelerate growth. We will both lean into store closures and leverage the significant number of lease expirations coming due over the next several years to restructure our Bed Bath & Beyond store portfolio while, in parallel, look at our other retail banners, drive cost productivity and accelerate improvements designed to help stabilize the business and deliver long-term profitable results. As previously said, we plan to move forward with about 200 store closures across the country over the next two years. While we expect the closures to unfavorably impact our top line, there is significant EBITDA upside.As we restructure the real estate portfolio, we will drive cost productivity and continuous improvement efforts to enable investments in operational capabilities to sustain business results. In the future, we will also test new store format economics and locations with the goal to strategically grow market share profitably. Next, I'll provide an update on our end-to-end redesign of our global supply chain or e2e for short, which is a multiyear initiative intended to deliver a new supply chain and technology infrastructure to enhance fulfillment, drive cost savings, improve the customer experience and support the acceleration of omnichannel enhancements. The redesign road map touches all aspects of our business, including our product assortment, vendors, fulfillment centers, and stores all in support of our customers' experience and cost-efficiency.The program is expected to reduce our working capital requirements, significantly expand our direct sourcing and importing capabilities, and further optimize our network routing. The redesign will facilitate growth in owned brands, improvements in lead time for store ordering, and support enhanced omnichannel capabilities to drive digital growth. As part of the program, we plan to realign our network of pool points that replenish our store inventory, which will optimize our in-stock numbers and reduce store inventory requirements. We also plan to drastically reduce by the millions the number of annual vendor purchase orders we create, which our vendors will love.It will also drive greater efficiencies within our accounts payable area. And we plan to further optimize our fulfillment network routing to increase one-day deliveries from our DCs and store locations. Overall, the e2e redesign is targeted to deliver significant savings over the next three years, a reduction in inventory, and faster lead times. Through this initiative, we expect to deliver significant future cost savings while driving greater efficiencies across the supply chain.Technology will support the bulk of the redesign work, and our teams are creating a more modern technology stack and efficient operating model to serve the company's transformation efforts. We are currently planning for the migration of our data and computing to the cloud, which will expedite and enhance our technology capabilities. We look forward to sharing more on this and the progress of all of these operational initiatives in the future. I will close with a brief update on the performance of our Buy Buy Baby banner during the quarter.On a directional basis, our U.S. and Canadian Buy Buy Baby business made up approximately 20% of our company's total net sales in the first quarter, compared to about 10% last year. We remain very pleased with the business and how our teams excelled in creating a positive customer experience and providing the essential items they need to care for their families. Early on, Buy Buy Baby was deemed an essential retailer, and roughly 97% of our U.S.stores remained open during the pandemic. The spirit our people have shown to fight for our customers and our company has been just tremendous, ensuring we were in stock on the most essential items like diapers, wipes, formula, and baby food goes to the heart of our commitment to our customers. A key highlight of our performance was when our BABY stores led the company's pilot and standup of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup boosting online sales of toddler food, safety equipment, playroom items and sleepwear. Even with stores open, Buy Buy Baby's digital business grew almost as exponentially as a total company's digital sales in the quarter.In response to the rapidly changing customer demands, Buy Buy Baby quickly shifted its marketing approach to support growing online demand through increased digital marketing and adjusted content to reflect customer needs. For example, we enhanced our baby registry program to support expecting parents during these challenging times, including a new phone consultation service, enabling customers to ask questions to an expert baby registry advisor. We also launched Design Squad, an innovative one-stop shop for nursery design services and inspiration in partnership with our sister brand, Decorist. With a mission to provide parents everything they need to confidently prepare for their baby, we are reminded during these difficult times how important our role in their journey can and should be.I will now turn the call over to Joe.Joe Hartsig -- Chief Merchandising Officer and President of Harmon Stores"}, {"statement_num": 6, "section": "pres", "statement_type": "P", "speaker": "Joe Hartsig", "role": "Chief Merchandising Officer and President of Harmon Stores", "affiliation": "", "text": "Thank you, John, and hello, everyone. It certainly has been an exciting time to join Bed Bath & Beyond. Since arriving in March, I've learned so much in a really short amount of time, and I have to say I'm incredibly encouraged by how quickly our teams have responded in meeting the needs of our customers during this challenging time. The opportunity to make it easy for our customers to feel at home has never been greater.Today, let me start with some highlights of the quarter from a commercial perspective, and then I'll provide an update on our transformation progress within the merchandising area. As the impact of temporary store closures became apparent in March, we became incredibly agile and pivoted our merchandising and marketing approach starting with expense control. We quickly canceled product purchase orders and modified future purchases to reduce merchandising inventory exposure and managed costs. We converted doors into regional fulfillment centers and redirected products from closed doors to these fulfillment stores, as well as to our web warehouses to support increased digital demand.And we partnered with vendors to increase supply of and expedite high demand products as customer needs were changing, as well as to optimize working capital. We also adjusted our marketing plan by minimizing or canceling print programs, brand campaigns, and events, and we're focused on driving in-store-only traffic. We adapted our marketing communications to better engage our customers online and stay relevant. Turning our attention to our digital business, we shifted our collective efforts to capitalize on the strong online demand as customers sheltered in place.We created daily working teams focused on inventory flow and built new reporting to keep top items in stock. We increased our digital marketing spend to drive traffic to our websites, including increased investments in search, paid social, and affiliate marketing to reach new customers online. We also refreshed our website with a more modern look, feel, and voice aligned to customer insights, as well as with our new branding. Finally, we incorporated key learnings about customer behavior through detailed site metrics from partners like Pinterest to optimize merchandising and messaging.During the first quarter, we had greater than 200 million visits across our digital properties, which is more than a 35% increase over the prior-year period. We also had in excess of 500,000 downloads of our Bed Bath & Beyond mobile app across Apple and Google Play stores, which contributed to strong revenue demand from our mobile channel, which is up 134% compared to last year. And as Mark mentioned earlier, new customer acquisition through our digital channels was also strong with nearly 40% of our online orders placed by customers new to ordering online, including over 10% that were completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond. Third-party data show that, overall, Bed Bath & Beyond saw stronger online engagement rates than our peers during the quarter, including higher conversion derived from first-time purchasers.These are important insights for us to leverage as we further analyze our customer behavior trends to develop more advanced engagement tactics. These efforts in digital marketing, merchandising and agile fulfillment, along with the rollout expansion of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services, helped support explosive growth across our digital channels in the first quarter. As John described earlier, customer adoption of our BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services is extremely exciting, and our online customer ratings for these omnichannel services are high. We have created a great new opportunity to make it even easier for our customers to shop with us in new and safe ways.We have already enhanced this service with a new mobile app experience launched last month that allows customers to place BOPIS orders, check into the store, and receive curbside orders from their cars all from their phones. In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond stores are now offering Apple Pay to simplify the transaction process. From a product perspective, we saw product category trends in our own online business during the first quarter that were similar to broader market trends. For Bed Bath & Beyond, kitchen and food prep was the top-performing category online across each of the three months, including sales of kitchen electrics, which grew more than 117% as customers prepared more food at home.Sales of water filtration systems spiked in March and April coinciding with the broader market trends of stockpiling on the essentials. Cleaning and home care was another strong product category throughout the first quarter with online sales of vacuums up 129%, significantly outperforming compared to last year. The baby and toddler categories performed well online throughout the quarter, peaking in April due to strong overall demand for baby essentials and our acceleration of BOPIS and Curbside Pickup. In May, as customer behavior turned more inwards to providing comfort and enjoyment in the home, we saw strength in our bedding category beginning to grow driven by basic sheets, pillows, and comforters.As we commenced store reopenings in late May and early June, we have seen the excitement in our customers looking to shop our total store across the board again. Kitchen electrics like mixers continued the surge in sales, up 75%, as customers enjoyed cooking for their families who were gathered at home. We are also seeing a surge in outdoor living categories as customers invest in their home spaces and migrate from the inside to the outside of the house in the summer months. At a time when our homes have become the center of our lives, we are very excited about the work that we're doing on the merchandising team in support of our new customer journey purpose, make it easy to feel at home.We have developed a robust plan under the strategic framework of our five key pillars: product, price, place, promise, and people to rebuild our merchandising authority in the home space, to stabilize the business and optimize for growth. Simply put, product is at the heart of what we do. Our goal is to create a differentiated and curated assortment that appeals to a broader array of customers from Gen Z to boomers, inspiring them to shop with us and making it easier to find what they need. Some of our initiatives under way include curating a new customer-driven assortment starting in key bed, bath and kitchen categories, including which products we should carry, which products we should add and which we should eliminate; developing and expanding our owned brand portfolio; and to enhance our differentiation in the market.Next year in fiscal 2021, we plan to launch a number of exciting owned brands across multiple categories and aim to create preference through our quality brands and products; negotiating improved costs and terms from our suppliers so we can increase our competitiveness in the marketplace; ensuring higher levels of in-stocks and inventory turns while placing the right amount of product in the right stores through improvements in forecasting and centralized inventory replenishment logic; and establishing a vision for a new and improved omni-always customer experience both in stores and on our digital sites. Additionally, price is a key driver of our ability to gain customer trips and frequency, as well as long-term loyalty. The goal of this pillar is for Bed Bath & Beyond to be known as a specialty products retailer by offering clear and compelling values. Key areas of focus include ensuring we have a competitive everyday pricing by leveraging our new dynamic online pricing engine and testing localized pricing for margin opportunity; building new end-to-end promotional tools and processes as well as optimizing our promotional spending and therefore, profitability; recurating our assortment to ensure we have the right price points and true value representation to better compete with mass-market retailers; and evolving and modernizing our loyalty programs to better engage and retain more of our valuable customers.Lastly, we have launched an integrated planning process for our stores and our digital platform that will tie the product and price pillars together with place and promise, creating a consistent, compelling omnichannel experience for our customers in line with our strategic intent. We are excited about this new way to create a stronger merchandising and marketing plan and look forward to sharing our progress further with you. So while we're busy transforming for the future, we remain very focused on our store reopening plans and capitalizing on the momentum we have in our digital business. As an example, we have overhauled and elevated our back to college program this year, which brings to life greater ease and affordability.With four value-oriented and affordable options, combined with the ease and convenience of our signature College Registry and Pack & Hold services, we can help them make often stressful college transition experiences that much easier. Overall, we are very encouraged about the progress being made to rebuild our authority within the home space with our customers. While we are in the early stages of this transformational work in merchandising, we are confident that our initiatives such as refining and elevating assortment through our customer-centric plans, strengthening a better communicating value, and modernizing our online store experiences for the new omnichannel approach are the right strategies. Our teams are embracing this change and leaning into the new strategic direction with excitement.I'll now turn the call back over to Mark.Mark Tritton -- President and Chief Executive Officer"}, {"statement_num": 7, "section": "pres", "statement_type": "P", "speaker": "Mark Tritton", "role": "President and Chief Executive Officer", "affiliation": "", "text": "Thanks, Joe.

There could be the checks from the government that are affecting the outcomes, but overall, we're seeing good patronage, good traffic, and the trends staying stabilized.

So we are and have negotiated substantial savings in our COGS line. We're refashioning our assortment to lean into owned brands, which will have a supplementary benefit to margin. We are transforming our IT and general infrastructure costs with great savings.We are going to look at the store rationalization program, which will add dollars to the EBITDA line. And we were fortunate enough in February 28, to already embark on a very strong $85 million cost reduction, which was fortuitous ahead of the COVID moment.

And we are not waiting.We are not waiting to take action. Some actions we're taking in February, as Mark alluded to and we all know, and some actions will continue to be taken shortly. You think of this, right, Q1 SG&A was down 15%, and that was really after intervening in the last two months of the quarter.

As we've come through into the June-July period, what we're seeing is our BOPIS and store fulfill taking up to 30%, 40% of our mix and changing our cost structure. We're also seeing our natural margin mix across the board come into play.So I don't think that Q1 is indicative of anything much. It's really trapped in time.

This is Joe again. So I think as Mark had mentioned, price is one of the five key pillars that we're focused on. So when you think about price and promo, that all comes together under value.Value is important to our customers, and it's something we've taking very seriously. As a new management team, we're spending a lot of time talking about this and evaluating it and formalizing our strategy so we can evolve it. Coupon, as you well know, is a big part of our mix today, but we're doing work on baseline pricing, like we launched dynamic pricing late last year. I think you've seen some more competitive price gaps to market over the last 6 months, which is something we wanted to effect, and we'll continue to evaluate more categories that we would look to put into dynamic pricing.But overall, pricing and promo is something we're, again, spending a lot of time on, and it's come into play in a few different ways. One, we're establishing category roles where we want to better guide our pricing strategies, so we are more focused on where we want to make price investments. Two, we're activating thorough line reviews where we can affect pricing in conjunction with supplier discussions. We're using owned brands, and we will be more proactively in the future to address opening price points and good price points.And then we're also looking at new promotional tools to optimize promotions so that we can make sure when we do invest in promotions, that promotional spend is very effective and efficient. And then lastly, I would say, over the long term, right, we are studying new ways to, again, evolve our loyalty programs because we think that there's new ways and more important ways to retain our customers.

This is a tricky moment in time, and I do think this moment suggests that maybe more can be retained digitally than ever before.

So I'm not going to get specific, but look, I mean, yes, it's in the realm. I think we're looking at 2019 numbers, and clearly, 2020 is going to be a different ballgame in the end of the play. What we see is a slightly different issue to a lot of our competitors because we've been able to establish market density overlap and therefore, duplication of the market.So we've got maybe two stores addressing 1 market that we could actually collapse higher-level sales into. We've done the algorithmic math on this very, very carefully. We will see some sales degradation. We'll see some move into digital.We'll see some transfer. But the net-net of what we will achieve will be a really strong positive to the bottom line in terms of EBITDA, and then we can set about filling in some of the market-based gaps that we see maybe with a different format store or repositioning some of our fleet to really address the total market buys and scope. So it's a reframe and then reshape, but at the heart of it is the net-net benefit to EBITDA along the way. Again, we'll map out that in a sequential by-year impact.Some of it will begin in Q4 of 2020, but the majority of it will be over the next two years.

It sets up in stores over the full month of July and a little bit into August, but we've been active in digital for several weeks. We are very pleased with the double-digit gains we've seen both in-store and online, and the result of both engagement conversion, sales, AUR, it's off and running. Now it did break late as per these changes.But we, several months ago, were correlating, as John mentioned, with companies like Pinterest, and we established that people were pinning back to college ideas very early and still very relevant in the consumer line set. We've lent in here we have sharper price value. We have clear store and digital setups that's unique and aligned. We really have a very comprehensive program.It's off and running, and it's only early onset. So we see that prevailing through the rest of the quarter. What depth and penetration it has, I'm not going to share, but positive along with the already positive indicators that we've had on the rest of our assortment.
