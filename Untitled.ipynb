It can be found at www.kurasushi.com in the Investor Relations section. A copy of the earnings release has also been included in an 8-K we submitted to the SEC.Before we begin our formal remarks, I need to remind everyone that part of our discussions today will include forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. We refer all of you to our recent SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition.Also, during today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures are available in our earnings release.With that out of the way, I would like to turn the call over to Jimmy.Hajime \\\"Jimmy\\\" Uba -- President and Chief Executive Officer\"\n",

      "      \"text\": \"Thank you, Ben, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As most of you know, our restaurants have been largely closed during our fiscal third quarter. As a result, we would like to spend today's call providing you with an update on our business operations and initiatives. If you have specific questions about our third quarter financial results, we will be happy to answer your questions during Q&A.As we discussed on our last call, we entered 2020 with very solid momentum across our restaurants that continued into January and February of this year. March was a challenging month across the restaurant industry as the news about COVID-19 began to spread.On March 18th as official guidelines featured mandatory shutdown of in-restaurant dining, we made the difficult decision to close all our restaurants systemwide. From the start of the pandemic, our primary concerns have been the safety of our guests, the ongoing health and the welfare of our team, our liquidity and our ability to quickly and efficiently resume operations when the time was right.To support our team during this difficult time, we maintained payroll for all employees through equity to fixed and expanded the payroll for all the kitchen employees through May 9th. We have also continued to pay the full cost of health insurance for all of our furloughed employees and stayed connected with our furloughed team members throughout their absence.In addition to our store managers, critical kitchen staff members have remained on payroll as we believed that the near-term expense of retention will be lesser than potential of a reduced sales due to under-staffing. Finally, all store-level employees that were furloughed in April were eligible for a return bonus in June to further incentivize their return to Kura. These actions have allowed us to bring back our people quickly and open our restaurants with minimal delays. Thanks to our team engagement efforts [Indecipherable] of our employees left the Company between the end of March to early July, which has positioned us to ramp up quickly as indoor dining restrictions are lifted and the seating capacity limitations are relaxed.As official restrictions have been lifted across the country, we have opened our restaurants promptly and successfully, however at reduced capacity in accordance with local government requirements. We began the reopening process on May 22nd and by the end of May, we had already opened seven of our restaurants. 14 additional restaurants were opened throughout June and as of today, all Kura Sushi restaurants are opened for business.However, as you are likely aware, Governor Newsom of California announced a restriction on all indoor dining on July 1st for a minimum of three weeks. As a result, all of our California stores, most of which had reopened with limited indoor dining, are currently open for to-go service only. We are now actively working on building out our off-premises business and the infrastructure for all of our restaurants. We have taken a number of steps to create a safer environment in our restaurants, such as providing personal protective equipment for our team members, enhancing the cleaning processes, maintaining social distancing and performing team member health checks before the start of each shift. The health and the safety of our guests and the team members will always be our top priority.As part of our checkout process, we have a customer survey which is now focused on our COVID-19 safety procedures. I am pleased that by the end of June, we have received more than 15,000 guest responses and over 96% rated our efforts as four or five out of a five-point scale. Considering our restaurants were closed during most of the third quarter, I would like to discuss some results for the month of June. Overall, we've been pleased with the initial results of our openings. However, as you might imagine, subtleness of the reopening under the closing policy changes in our various markets as well as other COVID-19 related issues throughout the country have made recent sales trend more challenging to assess.Due to our sudden [Phonetic] reopening schedule in May and June only seven stores were opened for the entire month of June. Of these seven stores, five stores were in our comp base and saw same-store sales decline of 48.6%, largely reflecting the 50% seating capacity restrictions for these stores. We are extremely encouraged by these comps which we feel illustrated the strong consumer demand for our unique dining experience. We believe our reopenings are moving in the right direction and reopening our valued room has allowed us to better manage our pandemic-related losses.Now I would like to provide a brief update on our development efforts. As most of you know, we began the year with the expectation of opening six new restaurants in fiscal 2020. Two new restaurants Katy, Texas and Glendale, California opened during the fiscal Q2 prior to the temporary shutdown. However, as we mentioned during last quarter earnings call, our opening schedule has been filled due to the pandemic. All restaurants were under construction in mid-March, Fort Lee, New Jersey; Koreatown in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and Sherman Oaks, California.After a brief interruption, all four have resumed the construction and we have started the work on our Bellevue, Washington site as well. Fort Lee and Koreatown are both very nearly complete although their opening dates will depend on the coronavirus situation in their respective areas. During our temporary closures, we also completed renovations for seven of our restaurants. By completing these renovations during the pandemic, we are able to avoid the sales losses associated with closures for renovations during non-pandemic periods.I would like to announce the latest addition to our executive team, Robert Kluger, our first Chief Development Officer. Most recently, Robert was Senior Vice President of Development for Blaze Pizza where he oversaw the company's growth from 140 to 350 units. Prior to Blaze Pizza, he spent six years at Panera Bread ultimately becoming their Senior Manager of Franchise Development and 12 years at the Panda Restaurant Group where he was Vice President of Real Estate and Strategy. Robert has been responsible for over 1,000 store openings with nationally successful brands and we are incredibly excited about the impact we believe he can have on our long-term growth.Speaking to our liquidity, despite the ongoing uncertainty, we are very fortunate to have entered this unique situation with a strong capital position. As of today, we have approximately $14 million in cash on hand and no debt. Our $20 million revolving line of credit from Kura Sushi Japan remains secure. Although we have not borrowed any amount against it, we will likely begin tapping our revolver to fund our capital expenditures during the upcoming fiscal year. We appreciate the support of Kura Japan and we have confidence in the long-term success of our business.Considering Governor Newsom's announcement yesterday concerning additional COVID-19 prevention measures, which include more extensive dining prohibitions in California, it appears unlikely that we'll be able to reopen our California dining rooms prior to the end of our fiscal year. During our California dining room closures, we expect our weekly cash burn rate to be in the area of $800,000 to $850,000 which include $400,000 of capex. Once we are able to reopen our California restaurants, we would expect that this weekly burn rate to be reduced by approximately $50,000. Although, we've been able to reduce our operating losses by reopening our restaurants, these gains have been offset by the additional capital expenditures associated with the construction of five new units previously mentioned.One final reminder, due to the uncertainty driven by COVID-19, we will not issue financial guidance for the remainder of fiscal year 2020 at this time. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your interest in Kura Sushi, USA. We were extremely excited about the potential of our business before the threat of COVID-19 and we remain equally confident that when this crisis passes, we have a long runway for opportunity ahead of us. Before we open the line for questions, I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work, flexibility and support as we navigate this unchartered territory. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to answer any questions you have. As a reminder, during the Q&A session, I may answer in Japanese before my response is translated in English. Please bear with us. Operator, please open the line for questions.\"\n",

So we're thinking just in the interest of time that we're going to use this period and we're going to use that third-party service to power our online ordering capabilities. Right know it's going to be less profitable than having our own in-house ordering system just because of service fees. But this is all -- we're treating all this as like an investment.

So it's kind of a moot point for us.One thing that was really interesting is that people are very understanding and forgiving of not having the conveyor belts live just because it's the pandemic. But given that this is one of the signature features of our restaurant, we plan on bringing this back as soon as we think the timing is right. We don't want to lose something that's so core to our identity.I spoke with a customer at a service department and luckily there is only one complaint and that was because a family had driven 30, 40 minutes for the excitement of the conveyor belt and they were a little bit disappointed that we weren't able to provide that. So if this were to -- if this use of the primary belt were to continue for a long time, we do think this would make us a little bit less attractive.

In terms of what our guests looks like, we've seen a modest shrinking of our average party size. We're no longer seeing large parties of five or six and -- so that's been driving that. It's possible that fewer kids are coming because there are fewer large parties and children bring down average tickets.
